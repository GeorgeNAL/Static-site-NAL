### A real team! (And everything that goes with it)  

* Accountability on the tough days. Support on the rough days. Celebrations and appreciation on the good days.
* Hang out with other people who <em>actually get</em> what you're doing.
* Eventually, things like gear, coaching, etc.

### Team Competition

* Wear your colors. Compete as a team. Go for the win as a team. Represent your community, town or city... as a team.
* New format and structure makes athletics matches (not “track meets”) crisp, organized and enjoyable for you and whoever comes to watch.

### Not only are you not done yet, you're one of the first

Just about everything here is new, except for how you’ll be jumping, running and / or throwing. You’ll be doing what you love, but for a club and in a set-up unlike anything that’s been done (at least not in this sport).
