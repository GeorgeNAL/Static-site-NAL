<p class="message"> Successful and popular clubs will draw more people to take up athletics, either through the clubs, schools or with individual coaches.</p>

### Scholastic coaches 

Anything that drives demand for jumping, throwing and running ensures the athletics director and administration keep your T&F teams funded.

### Independent coaches

The more people who want to throw, jump and run, the more people who will be visiting your websites, your YouTube pages, finding you on CoachUp and calling you to schedule sessions (those that donâ€™t join the clubs, that is!).
